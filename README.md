# BoopCS2401FINAL

This is my final project for CS 2401: Intro to Computer Science with Prof. Linder.
The aim was to remake a board game called Boop using CPP and the terminal. The current version can be played single-player against a bot that uses the MinMax algorithm to determine its next move. The bot is not unbeatable.
